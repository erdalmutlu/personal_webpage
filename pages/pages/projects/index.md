**Race Detection for Hybrid Applications** (Fall 2015 -- Present)  
We developed race detection techniques for applications using hybrid programming models combining data-flow constructs with shared memory programming model. We implemented our tool for Atomic Dataflow programming model that is developed in Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

**Race Detection for JavaScript Web Applications** (Fall 2014--Present)  
We introduced a race detection technique for JavaScript web applications using asynchronous constructs(user interaction, server requests). We instrumented Firefox web browser for collecting traces and applied our race detection technique on real world web applications.

**Behavior Exploration Techniques for Distributed Data Types** (Spring 2014)  
We investigated different data types used in distributed systems (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), Cloud Types etc.) and formalized techniques for exploring possible behaviors of interactions between client and server.

**Randomized Schedule Exploration for Hybrid Applications** (Fall 2013)  
We presented a dynamic verification technique for a class of concurrent programming models that combine dataflow and shared memory programming. We identified and illustrated a novel category of bugs in these hybrid concurrency programming models and provide a technique for randomized exploration of program behaviors in this setting.

**Face Detection Optimization for System-on-Chip** (Fall 2012)  
We developed an optimized scheme for calculating the integral image and applying the face detection which optimizes the memory usage so that it can be used in SecSoC, which targets to achieve video surveillance application on energy optimized microprocessors.

**High Level Rule Modeling Language for Airline Crew Pairing** (Fall 2009--2010)  
We introduced a high-level domain specific language and implement a compiler for generating rule based feasibility controls and cost calculations in crew pairing systems. We generate run time methods for the crew pairing systems where end-users are able to change the feasibility rules without interacting with the crew pairing engine itself.
